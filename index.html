							I joined the Game Experience Squad working in a front-end developer role, dealing with React, HTML and CSS along with pixi.js.
							Using my pixi.js knowledge I was instantly able to help with anything on the Prize Machine. As well as picking up any other tickets or giving a hand to other developers through pair programming.
							<br />
							After rising to Senior Software Engineer I took ownership of the Minigame projects and worked with product owners, marketing and design to see new projects from design all the way through to fruition. Writing tickets, creating specifications, working with and delegating to other developers to help with the day to day workload.
							I continued to work on other parts of the codebase as well, including writing proof of concepts and experiments to help improve the user experience.
							<ul>
								<li>
									Developing and maintaining multiple minigame projects.
								</li>
								<li>
									Maintaining legacy code and refactoring where possible.
								</li>
								<li>
									Working with external parties to create new supplier integrations.
								</li>
								<li>
									Helping graduate and junior programmers on the team through pair programming and mentoring.

							Hired as a game developer, I was put in charge of creating the new front-end framework, capable of handling 2D & 3D graphics on desktop and mobile.
							Using modern javascript technologies, such as: ES6, ESLint, JSDoc, Jest, pixi.js and three.js.<br>
							At the start I was the sole developer so I concentrated on making a solid foundation by creating the git workflow, coding style and standards as well as writing tests and documentation.
