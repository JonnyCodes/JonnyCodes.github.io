							Joining the Game Experience Squad, working in more of a front-end developer role, mainly dealing with React, HTML and CSS along with pixi.js.

							<ul>
								<li>
									Developing Prize Machine addons and themes.
								</li>
								<li>
									Creating custom minigames: Unwrap the Cash and Bonus Rounds.

							Hired as a game developer, I was put in charge of creating the new front-end framework, capable of handling 2D & 3D graphics on desktop and mobile.
							Using modern javascript technologies, such as: ES6, ESLint, JSDoc, Jest, pixi.js and three.js.<br>
							At the start I was the sole developer so I concentrated on making a solid foundation by creating the git workflow, coding style and standards as well as writing tests and documentation.
