							<h4>TBA Board Game</h4>
							With a friend I have started work on a board game. It is a card collecting, dice rolling game with money management aspects. As well as working on the mechanics and rules, I have also been working on the design of the cards and dice. Being a programmer I made a couple of small apps to help with the development, a dice odds calculator and a card sheet compiler.

						<div class="project">
							<h4><a href="http://www.pixelescapegame.com/">Pixel Escape</a></h4>
							Pixel Escape started out as a small hack-a-thon project written in AS3.
							Working closely with a friend we released it for the web and started
							work on a mobile version. This required the code to be re-written in
							Haxe as well as optimizing the code and re-designing the UI. Unfortunately this project has now been shelved.

						<div class="project">
							<h4><a href="http://www.y8.com/games/monster_rush">Monster Rush</a></h4>
							I was commissioned by a Twitch streamer to create a small game to help
							promote his stream. Monster Rush was written in Haxe with all graphics
							and programming done by me. It has been released on multiple games
							portal sites and there are some plans for a mobile release in the future.

					<div class="project">
						<h4><a href="http://www.dinobuilders.com/">DinoBuilders</a></h4>
						DinoBuilders was a couple of firsts for me. It was my first Haxe &amp;
						OpenFL project, my first project as tech lead and the first time I trained
						up a junior developer. My main tasks was working on the minigame and
						overseeing the junior developer’s work.
					</div>
					<div class="project">
						<h4><a href="http://www.distroller.com/">Distroller</a></h4>
						Distroller was created on the Dubit Flash Virtual World Platform.
						Writing in AS3 and Flex I worked on creating rooms, UI and the
						minigames. During the development of this project I worked closely
						with the tech lead and the clients to help deliver the product they
						wanted. This included being sent on a work trip to Mexico to help train
						up one of the clients developers on Dubits internal scripting language.
					</div>
					<div class="project">
						<h4><a href="http://firebugsofancora.com/">Firebugs of Ancora</a></h4>
						Firebugs of Ancora was a smaller project to help promote a larger game
						that Dubit also created. Firebugs was created using the AS3 starling
						engine and nape for the physics. This was my first ever solo project, I
						took over from the tech lead early on in development and worked hard
						to deliver a great mobile game.
