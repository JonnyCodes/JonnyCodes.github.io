							<h3>Core Gaming</h3>
							<span class="subtitle">December 2018 - Present</span>
						</div>
						<div class="project">
							Hired as a game developer, I was put in charge of creating the new front-end framework, capable of handling 2D & 3D graphics on desktop and mobile.
							Using modern javascript technologies, such as: ES6, ESLint, JSDoc, Jest, pixi.js and three.js.<br>
							At the start I was the sole developer so I concentrated on making a solid foundation by creating the git workflow, coding style and standards as well as writing tests and documentation.

						<div class="project">
							Hired as a software engineer to work within a small team to create high quality omni-slot games.
							I quickly picked up the libraries, frameworks and workflow allowing me to hit the ground running and start creating games as soon as possible.
							I was making contributions to the framework within the first week and took it upon myself to oversee the maintenance of one of the internal libraries.
							<ul>
								<li>
									Contributed to the adoption and implementation of git workflow for the studio.
								</li>
								<li>
									Created an internal translation tool to help speed up the translation process, which was quickly shared between a number of studios.
								</li>
								<li>
									Researched and developed a proof of concept to help reduce animation files size.
								</li>
								<li>
									Help maintain legacy code by fixing bugs in older projects.

						Himalayas was one of my favourite projects to work on. After completing the game ahead of schedule I was able to have some creative input and created a dynamic weather system.

									<h4><a href="https://armorgames.com/play/15830/pixel-escape">Pixel Escape</a></h4>
									Pixel Escape started out as a small hack-a-thon project written in AS3.
									Working closely with a friend we released it for the web and started
									work on a mobile version. This required the code to be re-written in
									Haxe as well as optimizing the code and re-designing the UI. Unfortunately this project has now been shelved.
								</li>

									<h4><a href="http://www.y8.com/games/monster_rush">Monster Rush</a></h4>
									I was commissioned by a Twitch streamer to create a small game to help promote his stream. Monster Rush was written in Haxe with all graphics and programming done by me. It has been released on multiple games portal sites and there were some plans for a mobile release in the future.
