						</div>
						<div class="project">
							I joined the Game Experience Squad as a Software Engineer, working in a front-end developer role. Dealing with React, HTML and CSS along with pixi.js.
							Using my pixi.js knowledge I was instantly able to help with anything on the Prize Machine. As well as picking up any other tickets or giving a hand to other developers through pair programming.
							<br />
							After rising to Senior Software Engineer I took ownership of the Minigame projects and worked with product owners, marketing and design to see new projects from design all the way through to fruition. Writing tickets, creating specifications, working with and delegating to other developers to help with the day to day workload.
							I continued to work on other parts of the codebase as well, including writing proof of concepts and experiments to help improve the user experience.
							<br />
							Looking at stretch and develop my skillset I have taken a secondment opportunity to work on a react native mobile app, DIBZ. Working with a team based in Portugal.
